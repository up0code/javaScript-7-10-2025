 // A- each variable the collectiion 
    
 
 //  - knowns as an Element can be of any of data type 
  
 
 2-  by its numeric index '' which starts from 0 


    This makes arrays a powerful tool for managing
     and operating on lists of related data. 
                  Example-;
    instead of declaring separate variable for each item 
             
                   Like
    let magdi = " Canada";
     this is the first 
     Example
but for Array all its differend

Example of  Array ;

let magdi = ['Rwanda' 'Canada' 'Amearica'];

Q2. How do you create an array? Write at least three different ways to create arrays.
There are several ways to create an array in JavaScript, each with its own use case. 

1. Array literal []
The most common and preferred way to create an array is using literal notation with square brackets []. 
Syntax: let arrayName = [element1, element2, ...];
Example:

           let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
let emptyArray = []; // An empty array




This method is concise and readable,
 making it the standard for most situations. 
2. Array() constructor
You can create an array using the built-in Array() 
constructor. This method behaves differently
 depending on the number and type of arguments provided. 
With multiple arguments: When multiple elements are passed, it creates an array containing those elements.
javascript
let fruits = new Array("Apple", "Orange", "Plum");



With a single number argument: If a single number is passed, it creates an empty array with that specified length. This can lead to unexpected behavior and is a primary reason the literal method is preferred.
javascript
let sparseArray = new Array(5); // Creates an empty array with a length of 5.
console.log(sparseArray); // [ <5 empty items> ]



3. Array.of() method
The static Array.of() method creates a new array instance from a variable number of arguments, regardless of the number or type of the arguments. This method avoids the confusing single-argument behavior of the Array() constructor. 
Syntax: let arrayName = Array.of(element1, element2, ...);
Example:
javascript
let items = Array.of("chair", 123, true); // ["chair", 123, true]
let singleElement = Array.of(5);         // [5]—This is different from `new Array(5)`



Q3. What data types can you store inside an array? 
Create one array that mixes numbers, strings, and booleans.


In JavaScript, an array can store elements of any data type because it is a "dynamically typed" language. This flexibility means a single array can hold a mixture of numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and even other arrays.
Array with mixed data types
Here is an example of a single array that contains a number, a string, and a boolean:
javascript
let mixedData = [42, "Hello World", true];

console.log(mixedData[0]); // Output: 42
console.log(mixedData[1]); // Output: "Hello World"
console.log(mixedData[2]); // Output: true



Q4. What is the difference between an array and a
 single variable? Explain in your own words
 and give one code example to support your answer.


 The core difference between an array and 
 a single variable is the number of values 
 they can store: a single variable can hold
  only one value at a time, while an array 
  can store an ordered collection of multiple
  values under a single name. This allows arrays 
  to manage and operate on related data more 
  efficiently than using individual variables. 
Key distinctions
Feature 	Single Variable	Array
Value Storage	Holds one value, which can be of any data type (e.g., a number, a string, or a boolean).	Holds multiple values, which are stored in a specific order and can be of different data types.
Access	The value is accessed directly using the variable's name.	Individual values, or elements, are accessed using a numeric index, starting from 0.
Scalability	Not scalable for storing large or growing lists of related data, as you would need to create a new variable for every item.	Highly scalable for managing collections of data, allowing you to add, remove, and iterate over items without creating new variables.
Data Organization	Best for storing a single, independent piece of information.	Ideal for grouping related pieces of data, such as a list of names, scores, or product details.
Code example
Imagine you want to store the names of three students.
Using single variables
javascript
let student1 = "Asha";
let student2 = "John";
let student3 = "Nisha";

console.log(student2); // Output: John



To work with these variables, you would have to reference each one by its unique name, making the code cumbersome to manage if you had 30 or even 300 students. 
Using an array
javascript
let students = ["Asha", "John", "Nisha"];

// Accessing an element using its index
console.log(students[1]); // Output: J

let students = ["Asha", "John", "Nisha"];

// Accessing an element using its index
console.log(students[1]); // Output: John
Use code with caution.

This approach is more efficient and scalable. If you need to add a fourth student, you can simply add a new element to the array instead of creating a whole new variable. To perform an operation on all students, you can use a loop to iterate through the array.

Level 2: Accessing and Modifying Arrays
Accessing elements
Array elements are accessed using bracket notation, where you place the element's index inside square brackets ([]) after the array's name. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on. 
Access the first element: arrayName[0]
Access the last element: arrayName[arrayName.length - 1]
Access a nested element: For arrays within arrays, you can chain bracket notation: arrayName[index][subIndex]. 
Modifying elements
You can change an existing element by assigning a new value to it using bracket notation and the index. 
Modify an element: arrayName[index] = newValue; 
Adding elements
There are several methods for adding elements to an array. 
push()
Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange"];
fruits.push("Mango");
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"]
Use code with caution.

unshift()
Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Orange", "Mango"];
fruits.unshift("Apple");
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"]
Use code with caution.

splice()
Inserts, removes, or replaces elements at any position. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
// Insert "Grape" at index 1 without removing anything
fruits.splice(1, 0, "Grape");
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["Apple", "Grape", "Orange", "Mango"]
Use code with caution.

Removing elements
Like adding, several methods can be used to remove elements. 
pop()
Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(lastFruit); // Output: "Mango"
console.log(fruits);   // Output: ["Apple", "Orange"]
Use code with caution.

shift()
Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
let firstFruit = fruits.shift();
console.log(firstFruit); // Output: "Apple"
console.log(fruits);     // Output: ["Orange", "Mango"]
Use code with caution.

splice()
Removes elements from a specific index.
 The first argument is the starting index,
  and the second is the number of elements to delete. 
javascript
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Mango"];
// Remove 1 element starting at index 1
fruits.splice(1, 1);
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["Apple", "Mango"]
Use code with caution.

filter()
Creates a new array with all elements
 that pass a test implemented by a 
 provided function. 
 This is useful when you want to remove
  elements based on a condition without modifying the original array. 
javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number !== 3);
console.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
console.log(numbers);        // Original array is unchanged: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



Q5. How do you access specific items from an array? 
Write a program that prints the first and last elements of your array. 



Accessing specific elements from an array
In JavaScript, you access elements in an array using bracket notation, which consists of square brackets [] containing the element's index. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on. 
To access the last element, you use the array's length property and subtract 1, since the length property gives the total count of elements, not the index. 
Program to print the first and last elements
The following program demonstrates how to access and print the first and last elements of an array. 
javascript
// Create an array of fruits
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Grape", "Mango"];

// Print the first element (at index 0)
console.log("The first fruit is:", fruits[0]);

// Print the last element by using the array's length
let lastIndex = fruits.length - 1;
console.log("The last fruit is:", fruits[lastIndex]);

// Output:
// The first fruit is: Apple
// The last fruit is: Mango


Q6. How do you change a value in an array? 
Change one of the elements in your array and print the new array.


To change a value in a JavaScript array, 
you access the specific element you
 want to modify using its index and
  then assign it a new value. Because 
  arrays in JavaScript are mutable, 
  this change modifies the original array directly. 
Program to change an array element
This example starts with an array of 
fruits. We will change the value at a
 specific index and then print the 
 updated array to confirm the modification. 
javascript
// Create an array of fruits
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Grape", "Mango"];

// Print the original array
console.log("Original array:", fruits);

// Change the second element (at index 1) from "Orange" to "Banana"
fruits[1] = "Banana";

// Print the new array to show the changed value
console.log("New array with a changed fruit:", fruits);
Use code with caution.

Output:
Original array: [ 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Grape', 'Mango' ]
New array with a changed fruit: [ 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Grape', 'Mango' ]




Q7. What does .length do? 
Write a program that shows how many items are in your array. 


The .length property in JavaScript is 
used to get the number of elements 
in an array. It provides a convenient
 way to determine the size of an array. 
 Since it is a property and not a method, 
 you access it without parentheses,
  like arrayName.length.
   The value of length is always one greater than the highest index in the array,
    as indexing starts at 0. 
Program to show the number of items in an array
javascript
// Create an array of pets
let pets = ["dog", "cat", "fish", "hamster"];

// Use the .length property to get the number of items
let numberOfPets = pets.length;

// Print the result to the console
console.log("The number of pets in the array is:", numberOfPets);
Use code with caution.

Output:
The number of pets in the array is: 4



Q8. How can you add a new 
element to the end of an array without using 
.push()? Use array index assignment instead. 



To add a new element to the end of an array without using the .push() method, you can use index assignment with the length property. The key is to remember that an array's length property always returns a value one greater than its last available index. This means array.length is the perfect index to use for the new element. 
Program to add an element using index assignment
javascript
// Start with an array
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// Print the original array and its length
console.log("Original array:", colors); // Output: Original array: [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ]
console.log("Original length:", colors.length); // Output: Original length: 3

// Add a new element to the end using the length property as the index
colors[colors.length] = "yellow";

// Print the modified array and its new length
console.log("New array:", colors); // Output: New array: [ 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow' ]
console.log("New length:", colors.length); // Output: New length: 4




Level 3: Working with Loops and Arrays Q9. Write a program that 
prints all elements in an array using three different loops: 



You can print all the elements in an array using several different loops in JavaScript. Here are three common methods: the traditional for loop, the while loop, and the modern forEach() method.
Program to print all elements in an array
First, let's define an array to work with:
javascript
let groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "cheese"];
Use code with caution.

1. Using a traditional for loop
The classic for loop is ideal when you need to iterate a specific number of times and want to control the index.
javascript
console.log("--- Using a traditional for loop ---");
for (let i = 0; i < groceries.length; i++) {
  console.log(groceries[i]);
}
Use code with caution.

2. Using a while loop
The while loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance. In this case, we control it using a counter variable and the array's length.
javascript
console.log("\n--- Using a while loop ---");
let i = 0;
while (i < groceries.length) {
  console.log(groceries[i]);
  i++;
}
Use code with caution.

3. Using the forEach() method
The forEach() method is a cleaner, more concise way to iterate over an array. It executes a provided function once for each element.
javascript
console.log("\n--- Using the forEach() method ---");
groceries.forEach(function(item) {
  console.log(item);
});

// Or with a modern arrow function for even shorter syntax:
// groceries.forEach(item => console.log(item));
Use code with caution.

Combined output for all three loops:
--- Using a traditional for loop ---
milk
bread
eggs
cheese

--- Using a while loop ---
milk
bread
eggs
cheese

--- Using the forEach() method ---
milk
bread
eggs
cheese
